% NOTES FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

%% variable names (to be added)
% define all the variables in the structure str

%% ideas for future improvements

% Add references for algorithm (web pages, papers, books with page numbers)

% remove global

% separate and document as many functions as you can so they can stand alone

% Find a way to identify sparse combinations of variables that are
% identifiable.  That is, how to find simple sparse vectors that are in the
% null space of V(:,rS+1:n) or the span of V(:,1:rS)

% create a better interface for the profile leave one out analysis where
% the residual always is pass the full x vector

% define weights for the data and regularization terms based on
% wydata=   1/ standard deviation(ydata-zsol)
% wreg = 1/ standard deviation(p0 - xreg)

% change define model to change defaults?

% you have estimates for the residual these can be used to help quantify the practical identifiablity
